# A-Medical-Diagnostic-ChatBot-using-AI

This project develops a Medical diagnostic Chatbot that enables individuals to assess their health conditions before visiting a hospital. By utilizing advanced technologies such as Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Deep Learning (DL), the system provides an accurate pre-diagnosis based on the symptoms entered by the user.
Users interact with the system via a login interface and respond to symptom-related queries (yes/no) to describe their condition. The system evaluates these inputs using tools like pysklearn , nltk, TensorFlow, and OpenCV to analyze the symptoms. Additionally, the third-party Infermedica API processes the data to generate health insights and recommend appropriate online doctors for further consultation.
By automating the symptom-checking process, this system helps reduce the time and effort required for initial health assessments, providing individuals with valuable health information and timely medical recommendations. The overall goal is to improve healthcare accessibility, making it easier for users to evaluate their health condition in advance and seek professional care when necessary.
